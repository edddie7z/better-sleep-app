## How It Works

### Sleep Cycle Optimization

Sleep occurs in repeating cycles, each lasting about 90 to 110 minutes, moving through different sleep stages before starting over. To wake up feeling refreshed, it's best to wake up at the end of a cycle rather than in the middle of deep sleep.

Dreamr's sleep calculator helps optimize your sleep and wake-up times by aligning them with complete sleep cycles, reducing grogginess and improving overall rest quality.

### Key Features

1. **Calculate**: Input your desired bedtime or wake-up time to get recommendations based on complete sleep cycles
2. **Log**: Track your actual sleep patterns to build a comprehensive sleep history
3. **Analyze**: Gain insights into your sleep quality and patterns over time (Coming Soon)

## About Sleep Cycles

A typical sleep cycle consists of four stages:

1. **N1 (Light Sleep)**: The transition from wakefulness to sleep
2. **N2 (Light Sleep)**: Body temperature drops, heart rate slows
3. **N3 (Deep Sleep)**: Restorative stage with slow brain waves
4. **REM Sleep**: Brain activity increases, dreaming occurs

Understanding these cycles helps optimize wake-up times for better alertness and reduced morning grogginess.
